# Productivity Text RPG
A project which contains horrible code

##What is Productivity Text RPG?
This is essentially clones to https://habitica.com/static/front, just that I am doing it in C++, and probably will suck more.
On a upside, at least it's completely open-source, so if you find any bugs you wanna squash, you can just do it!

##How do I compile Productivity Text RPG?
Use a C++ compiler. For this project, I'm using GNU GCC 4.8.1-4 compiler, but you can probably use Visual C++ if you so desire.
Libraries used:
* wxWidgets (and it's d variants)
  * libwxmsw30u_core
  * libwxbase30u
  * libwxpng
  * libwxzlib
* Boost (and it's -d variants)
  * libboost_system
  * libboost_thread
  * libboost_timer
  * libboost_chrono
* Angelscript
  * libangelscript

##Is there a license for Productivity Text RPG?
I'm probably going to assign the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) soon. For now, don't do anything stupid D:<.

##Todo list?
Nope, who needs that shit when you can add everything your heart desires.
