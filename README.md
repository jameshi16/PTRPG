# Productivity Text RPG
A project which contains horrible code

##What is Productivity Text RPG?
This is inspired by https://habitica.com, done in C++, with code that sucks.
On an upside, it's completely open-source, so if you find any bugs you wanna squash, [do it](https://github.com/jameshi16/Productivity-TextRPG/issues)!

##How do I compile Productivity Text RPG?
Use a C++ compiler. For this project, I'm using GNU GCC 5.3.0 compiler targeted for i868 and x86_64, but you can probably use any other C++ compilers.
Libraries used:
* wxWidgets 3.1.0
  * libwxmsw30u_core
  * libwxbase30u
  * libwxpng
* Boost (and it's -d variants)
  * libboost_system
  * libboost_thread
  * libboost_timer
  * libboost_chrono
  * libboost_filesystem
  * libboost_date_time
* Angelscript
  * libangelscript (with scriptstdstring and scriptbuilder)

##Is there a license for Productivity Text RPG?
I'm probably going to assign the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) to it soon. For now, don't do anything stupid D:< with it D:<
